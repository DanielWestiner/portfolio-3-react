# Personal Portfolio Using React

## Description

This project was to update my personal portfolio to showcase the recent skills that I have learned in my budding career as a web developer. This portfolio was creating utilizing React.  I linked some of the projects that I have developed in these first couple months as well as linked all personal pages (LinkedIn, Github, my Resume, etc) on to the portfolio as well.
